    <p>
      Input the size of the inside of the box - or the size of the thing you
      want the box to contain. You can use centimeters or millimeters or inches.
      Whatever you like. The measurements will be specified with decimal
      precision (not fractions). The current default is in millimeters to avoid
      a bunch of fractions/decimals and makes a box thats about 4.3" x 6.3" x
      2". Use the inches to millimeters converter to give you a guide on what
      130 mm means in inches.

      Recommended spacing between the lid and the spine when you put it together
      is 2-3 times the board thickness. You can make a little spacer by gluing
      pieces of the book board together.
