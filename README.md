# Clamshell Computer

## Intro

This single page Svelte app is designed to both learn a little Svelte and compute sizes for
pieces to make a clamshell box following form the designs show [in this blog](https://www.handmadebooksandjournals.com/create-custom-books/boxes-and-slipcases/clamshell-box/clamshell-box-part-1/).

It's currently designed to be unitless but I would like to someday introduce the notion of inches vs mm and for inches
we'd show fractions. Computing them with JS is a little fussy sometimes so still working on a decent solution.
